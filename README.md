# ADDITIVE MODELS TO PREDICT CRITICAL HEAT FLUX IN SUBCOOLED FLOW BOILING

The critical heat flux (CHF) is the heat flux value in the boiling or cooling process in
which the heat transfer decreases, and the heated surface temperature rises rapidly due to
factors such as vapor films and bubbles. Due to the difficulties in elaborate experiments
and disagreements about measurement and evaluation techniques related to CHF, some
methods, like lookup tables, physical correlations, and machine learning, aim to predict
the CHF. Additive models are regression models that use an additive structure to define
the relationship between the input variables and the CHF to make predictions. This work
will compare multiple additive models with consolidated predictive methods in critical
heat flux prediction literature.

The code in this repository will be avaliable to any person interested to investigate the pros and cons of the use of additive models to predict the CHF on subcooled flow.
